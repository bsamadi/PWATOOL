# Computational Tools for Piecewise Affine Systems

PWATOOLS is a set of tools for the analysis and design of piecewise affine (PWA) systems with the following capablities:
- approximation of nonlinear systems by PWA systems
- stability analysis of PWA systems 
- controller synthesis for PWA systems
